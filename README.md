## Introduction

Welcome to the Etch-a-Sketch project! This project is part of the Foundations Course from Odin Project and provides an excellent opportunity to enhance my skills in DOM manipulation while building a fun and interactive web application. This project built on browser-based version of a sketchpad with elements inspired by an Etch-A-Sketch.

Etch a sketch game created with HTML, CSS and JS.

## Features

- Color Mode: A hover effect has been implemented to the grid divs so that they change the color based on the user's preference from the color picker.
- Darkening effect : A progressive darkening effect has been implemented where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square.
- Random Color Mode: Instead of a simple color change from black to white, each interaction has been randomised the squareâ€™s RGB value entirely.
- Clear: The clear button deletes all the grid's background property from the DOM.
- Eraser: The eraser button clears only any grid that has background color.
- Grid Size Adjustment: The slider button adjust the grid size from 1 to 100.
